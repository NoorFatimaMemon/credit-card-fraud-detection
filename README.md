# credit-card-fraud-detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning techniques. 

## Overview

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Load the credit card dataset using pandas.
2. Preprocess the data by sampling a fraction of it and exploring its characteristics.
3. Visualize the distribution of features and identify potential outliers.
4. Determine the proportion of fraudulent transactions in the dataset.
5. Explore the correlation between different features using a correlation matrix heatmap.
6. Prepare the data for model training by selecting relevant features and defining the target variable.
7. Implement two outlier detection algorithms, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, to detect fraudulent transactions.
8. Evaluate the performance of the outlier detection algorithms using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
